In this repository I have implemented a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.

Here the algorithm clusters the customers of a retail store following the Unsuperviced learning strategy by analizing the data of past purchase history of the store.

In this repository the dataset which has been used is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data
